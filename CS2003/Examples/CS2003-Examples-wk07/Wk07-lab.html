<p>As with all lab exercises, this exercise is not directly assessed. It is intended to complement the material presented in lectures. You are encouraged to complete it in your own time if you do not finish it during the lab hour.</p>
<p>The aim this week is to get more experience of using Javascript and using the Document Object Model (DOM). <strong>There are no fixed tasks this week</strong>, instead there are a number of different examples you should <strong>read, execute, change and explore</strong>. The more you try things out using these examples, the more experience you will get and the easier the practicals (and the exam) will be later. Remember – you learn by doing!</p>
<h1 id="things-you-might-try-out">Things you might try out</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Change the some of the JavaScript examples to do something else – create some tables of powers, times tables etc, add interactivity so you can choose a times table.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the array functions to play with arrays. Create some more functions of your own. Try out map.</p></li>
<li><p>Do some DOM manipulation, change the tree – if you get bored go crazy - have a look at - <a href="https://kickassapp.com">https://kickassapp.com</a>, work out what it is doing!</p></li>
<li><p>Try writing something like an Amazon purchase page where you have a number of items on a page (with suitable attributes) and the DOM gets rewritten based on some criterion from a drop down – sort by price, by name, by colour etc. If this is too much to do just sketch out how you might do it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You could do this for ever! Explore and try out the examples and learn by doing.</p>
