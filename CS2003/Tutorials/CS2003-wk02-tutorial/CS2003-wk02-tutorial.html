<li class="enumerate" id="x1-19x5">Finally, make sure that you have registered on the PeerWise system following the instructions in the separate handout. Create one question covering the topics from week 1, and tag this question with the tag &#8220;week-1&#8221;. You should also try to answer at least one question with the same tag. Your tutor will pick a question at random during the tutorial and you can go through it together as a tutorial group.</li>
